"@BillTieleman @OhSheri1 @GPNVAlison @FairVoteCanada @jkenney The PCs wouldn’t have been decimated. Instead, they would’ve been the second largest party in a minority legislature.

"@BillTieleman @OhSheri1 @GPNVAlison @FairVoteCanada @jkenney The end result was Kenney at the helm of the UCP, which was able to resolve the vote splitting problem.

"@BillTieleman @OhSheri1 @GPNVAlison @FairVoteCanada Nice try Bill, but I’m not going to let you straw man this argument.

In the 2015 election, the PCs were decimated despite getting nearly 30% of the vote. Rather than becoming the official opposition, they got less than half the seats of the far right Wildrose.

". #peipoli we wonder if PEI is working ... is it working for all students and teacher's? 

Why are our classroom sizes overloaded while we are closing rural schools? And what about empowering communities to lead with elected school boards?

@Smith80D @LeanRobert18 I think the 3 we've gotten since yesterday are fairly representative and high-quality (small provinces like #peipoli are sometimes better served without too much polling)

.#peipoli we place 2much importance on our current standardized testing system &amp; there are too many tests that force teachers 2 teach 2 the test.But we cant get rid of them all because they show gaps in the system. We must empower teachers2 lead the best way 4our youth forward.

@anhicken Except how @WadeMacLauchlan decided to dictate that the last referendum didn't count, b/c he didn't like the results. Blamed on low voter turnout. Yet when elected, he didn't see it that way even though it was the same story. #Misrepresentation #WhenItSuits #peipoli #NotMyPremier

PBB wants a reversal of the practice of giving a small number of large loans to (usually) already successful companies. Promises $2 mil is earmarked to giving a large number of small loans to young entrepreneurs. #peipoli
Last #peipoli tweet before the Leaf game... disappointed in the lack of substantial ag policy from all parties. Ag is PEI's biggest industry...deserves greater focus and innovative policy ideas. Ag sector needs more $$ to expand ongoing env sustainability efforts...win-win!

. #peipoli youth forum . We need to invest in public housing and shelters and stop investing in private developers. This is where the NDP differs from the Greens/PCs and Liberals.
"... um... everyone using a shelter is in acute need... right? PBBs answer about homelessness sounded paternal and patronizing. :(

Putting a few cents on gas and giving people free licenses is not going to result in a reduction in fossil fuel usage in a car-reliant province. Let's think harder. I wish there was more innovative policy on this from all sides #peipoli
The point that I feel gets missed about the PEI version of the carbon tax... individuals are being compensated for the increased cost of carbon, but our transportation-dependant industries aren't. I'm a proponent of a price on carbon... but has to done right #peipoli
