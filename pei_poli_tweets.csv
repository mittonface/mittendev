@benwedge I think it was meant to ensure that the executive council was answerable to the public (through the legislature).

"@educhatter @MNavarroGenie this reasoning feels flawed. ""The strong Atlantic Canadian presence in the governing party would decrease"""
"@educhatter @mnavarrogenie
1 - we shouldn't choose a voting system for Canada based on parochialism."
"@educhatter @mnavarrogenie
2 - instead of focusing on getting MPs in govt/cabinet, we'd be better off demanding better parliamentary govt"
"@educhatter @mnavarrogenie so MPs hold govt to account. W the current seat distribution, we won't see ANY Atl. Cdn MP hold gov to account"
"@educhatter @mnavarrogenie and,
3 - under MMP system, *the* governing party may not exist moot as multiparty coalitions become more common"
"@educhatter @mnavarrogenie in which case, having a mix of MPs from various parties would actually increase Atl. Cdn rep in gov"
"@educhatter @mnavarrogenie by not putting all eggs in one basket, giving Atlantic Canada play if it's either Lib-NDP or Lib-CPC coalition"
@MNavarroGenie @Educhatter explain.
"@mnavarrogenie @educhatter oh sure, but that would hinder our chances at policy success for the region in the case of coalition anyways."
@mnavarrogenie @educhatter the likelihood of being shut out of government entirely (or effectively) is far greater under FPTP than under PR.

"If it seems like ""gosh there sure are a lot of stories about questionable behaviour around local council tables..."""
That's not entirely inaccurate. Though it would be wrong to assume that it's something to do with the culture of local government itself.
On first glance it seems perfectly proportionate to the number of people involved in local government in NS.
"NS has less than 1M people, 11 Members of Parliament, 51 Members of the Legislative Assembly and 412 councillors and mayors. #nspoli"
There's just more people around at the local level to do the questionable things!

"FYI, we conduct provincial elections but not municipal elections. For info on Oct 15th muni elections: https://t.co/EpSGIJCF3i"
Today I was asked the following question by a reporter: “Why is the municipal election so boring?”
"And I must say, it is easily the most non-leading, fair minded, unbiased, objectively phrased question I’ve ever been asked."
"So many possible answers:
- 99/412 candidates are acclaimed.
- No competitive race for mayor in either CBRM or HRM"
"In many (though not all) competitive races, the distinctions between candidates aren’t palpable."
"If you’ve complained about political parties being too ideologically similar in NS, try figuring out the differences when you remove parties"
"Also - there’s far less room for ideology at the local level. Nobody seems to be taking a stand against clean water, sewage treatment, or.."
".. garbage pickup, etc. Most candidates are promising either more services, better services or both."
"I can think of a handful who are actually advancing intriguing policy ideas, but that’s a handful out of 740 candidates for 412 seats."
"@daryjessome I agree, that’s mine too! It’s still just one of 412 across the province."

"This was one of my favourite interviews. Wayne’s writing a book, btw. #nspoli #cdnpoli https://t.co/RWirVYhvkx"
It’s remarkable that people are still defending the mydemocracy.ca electoral reform survey. #cdnpoli #rejectedERQs
I understand where people are coming from who defended it on scientific grounds. There is valid methodology behind “even if” statements…
"But it would be far better to have asked questions like: “would you rather have parties that collaborate, or governments that keep promises”"
"It’s overly-simplistic in that those are false choices, it’s also overly-simplistic to suggest there’s no value in asking the question."
"There’s value in it, but you’ve also got to ask a dozen other questions challenge respondents to pick b/w two options on many…"
"seemingly unrelated or false-dilemmas. Pollsters like @VoiceOfFranky do it all the time, w pairwise comparisons/condorcet voting."
"The idea isn’t to offer people a choice between false-dilemmas, but to determine their priorities if there *were* such a dilemma"
"… you get people doing it over and over again, with a list of say 10 options, and force them to rank either-or for each possible combo"
… then what you’re left with is a staircase of priorities. it’s not to suggest that each of them are incompatible with the next…
… the average citizen will not have the ability to determine whether or not that is true (nor would the above-average citizen).
"Rather, the point would be to better understand which of those priorities is rated above all others more often than any of the others."
"That data is far more useful than asking respondents to rank their preferences from 1 - 10, because that’s surprisingly difficult to do."
"But, at this point, the MyDemocracy.ca survey is out there, and it has not passed the legitimacy test."
"“But it’s got the backing of politic scientists,” some might still argue. And perhaps they’d be right. But this is political."
"One can write a paper in academia on, say, why romantic relationships shouldn’t be discouraged in the workplace… and cite all the research"
"But the moment it becomes clear that one is involved in such a relationship, it changes how the reader interprets one’s work."
It’s similar to the challenge many people have with conflict of interest policies.
"Most policies say that one must recuse oneself from a decision, not only if a conflict exists, but if there is a perception of conflict."
I’m sure it’s typical for a few people to have objections to the way certain questions are asked on any survey.
"But in this case, there’s an overwhelming number of people who have objected to the way the questions have been asked."
"Even if you believe the survey is empirically rigorous, the public response to the survey should be enough to dismiss it’s results."
Why? Because it hasn’t passed the legitimacy test. There is too much well publicized resistance to it.
That resistance will undoubtedly contaminate the results. Every published article on the survey has noted it. Social media is full of it.
"Public engagement at its best is far from science, but we can do better. MyDemocracy.ca is far from public engagement at its best."

"@mattrisser It would be fine, so long as there were multiple false-trade offs. It’s the selectiveness that’s the problem."
"@MarkCoffin For sure. I counted 1 ""anti-Majoritarian"" question to 5 ""anti-PR"" ones. That's hardly balanced."
@MarkCoffin the forced choice is designed to provide an accurate hierarchy while avoiding the need for respondents to go through long lists
"@VoiceOfFranky Ah, I didn't realize that part, makes perfect sense though."
@MarkCoffin so instead of giving 20 choices at once we have a subset of R's do say 3 trials . Then assemble the tradeoffs into ranks
"@scotty_bowman a random probability sample of 688 is far more scientifically representative than a100K self selected , opt-in sample"
no consensus but pretty clear lean #cdnpoli https://t.co/KTcZOfgmsS
@VoiceOfFranky Was the second question given to respondents who also said no to the first? Should it have been?
@MarkCoffin this avoids the serious problem of asking R's to pick from a list longer than 4 or 5/ with attendant primacy and recency biases
@MarkCoffin Asking respondents to wade through lists of choices longer than 4 or 5 is poor design
@voiceoffranky I was asking more about those who said no to ‘should the federal gov’t replace FPTP’ question.
"@voiceoffranky in other words, what if you were to ask the ‘no’ respondents a ‘this is happening’ question, which system do you prefer?"

"But it's important to keep our attention on issues like this, as we near the midpoint of the Trudeau government's term in office. #cdnpoli"
"It was front and centre promise of their campaign, and should be an issue that is referred to and remembered at the midpoint of their term."
"Beyond that, distance from an issue makes the eyes look broader. Looking at the evolution of statements fr 2015 to 2017 is telling #cdnpoli"
"Simple analyses says that Trudeau simply promised electoral reform hoping it would get him elected, or make him official opposition leader."
"But looking through the history of their position over two years, it just seems like they bungled the file, and got trigger-shy. #cdnpoli"

Here’s this week’s podcast: unpacking how the former NS Cabinet ministers we spoke with approached their jobs. https://t.co/wlMuq8mgNa
The key take aways (for me) were these: most ministers took pride in making the right decision when something landed on their desk.
"Understandably, some Ministers were responsible for implementing platform promises, at the request of the Premier they served under."
"That took a separate and special kind of skill. Very few talked about initiating something of their own… an original idea, law or program."
"The idea of doing so was as foreign to them, as the idea of writing an extra essay just for fun would be to a university student."
"There was so much ‘assigned work’ that unless someone had a premeditated plan to initiate something, it was unlikely much else would happen."

"There was an episode of The Good Wife where lawyers references a decision by a court where a large (but private) university was told they were required to treat campus community members like citizens, and honour their civil rights as if they were a government..."
...rather than considering the citizen and corporation both as simply ‘persons’ under the law.
"I have no idea whether it was fictional or not, but increasingly it seems like the power and influence that these large platforms have over our lives, personal information, etc is less like another corporation and more like a government."
"And certainly, on a global scale, the power they wield surely surpasses that of many nations."
"Anyway, just curious if anyone has come across any scholarship or writing on the notion that the courts (or legislatures) might require such massive entities to self-regulate in a way that’s consistent with how governments act, versus be regulated by governments"
... (where governments are sure to get it wrong if they try).
@PhilMoscovitch If this is a Good Wife joke...
"@PhilMoscovitch And yes, beggars can’t be choosers!"
"@PhilMoscovitch Ah, yeah that seems somewhat inevitable. I guess I’m wondering if there are thinkers (legal or literary) who have theorized about world …"

"Paying a $2 monthly subscription to @hotspot_parking to pay the parking meter feels like a penalty from @hfxgov for not carrying coins. I'm sure I'm late to the game on this, but really? cc: @WayeMason @LindellSmithHFX"
"@hotspot_parking @hfxgov @WayeMason @LindellSmithHFX I'd actually be totally fine paying more for parking overall, if the @hfxgov would own their relationship with @hotspot_parking, but expecting citizens to 'subscribe' to a service to have convenient access to public space is nuts."
@hotspot_parking @hfxgov @WayeMason @LindellSmithHFX Corporate takeovers of the future will come one $2 subscription at a time...
@WayeMason @hotspot_parking @hfxgov @LindellSmithHFX Oh the private sector is far better at making things convenient than any govt body. I’m concerned more about the fact that the modern day normalcy of not carrying coins is penalized if joe citizen doesn’t subscribe to a $24/yr private service.
"@WayeMason @DartmouthDerek @hotspot_parking @hfxgov @LindellSmithHFX That’s good to hear. I think penalty is a fair descriptor. When I lived on the peninsula, I used coins for laundry and parking - nothing else. Coins are *effectively* a foreign currency."
@WayeMason @DartmouthDerek @hotspot_parking @hfxgov @LindellSmithHFX That’s not a fair comparison. Attendance at a ticketed event is a luxury in a way that parking in a public space is not. It’s “convenient” to use hotspot in the same way that it’s more “convenient” to get an MRI at a private clinic than to get on a public wait list.
Your regular reminder that Trump doesn't actually know what dogs do. https://t.co/czcKxrVoLo
"@WayeMason @DartmouthDerek @hotspot_parking @hfxgov @LindellSmithHFX I appreciate your thoughtfulness in engaging on this, and am sorry to have sparked a debate on whether $2/month is “worth it”. A no brainer - (of course it is!) but not the discussion I was trying to have on private sector intermediaries between public &amp; govt. ah twitter"
"Yesterday I made an observation about the slow creep of private sector forces into public space, which quickly turned into a conversation about whether the $2/month fee is worth the convenience provided by the new parking meter apps at HRM. https://t.co/iChRUf96Ah"
"To avoid starting that debate again, I wholeheartedly agree with everyone who thought they were disagreeing with me. $2/month for a convenient way to pay for parking all of HRM and other maritime cities is totally worth it!"
"It’s way more affordable than going to an ATM, then buying a pack of gum each time you park to make change; thinking ahead and carrying change *for that purpose alone*; or simply paying the tickets for not feeding the meter."
But the expectation that citizens subscribe and establish a financial relationship (however small) with an intermediary that’s collecting both money and data from them in order to access a public service/space is a slippery slope
"Now, and for the foreseeable future, governments are going to be slower at solving problems than the private sector is. And until we fix that problem, we’re going to have more problems of convenience where the govt service has not adapted to modern expectations,"
"and the only solution *inagineable* to most people is the one provided by the private sector, where government is either absent entirely where it used to have a role, or on the other side of an intermediary making profit off of government inefficiency."
Canadian Twitter fights often end up like this https://t.co/PoUsSSbpat
*imaginable
"@IaianArchibald Ask why it doesn’t have that capacity, and solve *that* problem instead of auctioning off access to the public to the lowest bidder. I’m not opposed to the contracting of private firms, with the government as the intermediary."
"@IaianArchibald Its more the idea that if you want a timely, convenient parking space/MRI/special needs school/other essential service you shouldn’t have to do business with a private firm"
"@IaianArchibald In my example yesterday I was parking downtown for an appt with a specialist. Virtually no free parking, and again it’s the principle of paying for convenience vs. putting up with public services."
"@IaianArchibald There’s plenty of folks who don’t think it’s a trade off. I suspect the bigger problem is that the elected officials (collectively, not individually) and public service (writ large) don’t operate from a place of citizen-service in the way businesses offer customer service."

"@IaianArchibald There’s nothing innovative about putting a credit card reader on a parking meter, or choosing to pay a private clinic to perform wait list MRIs, etc. Governments could exceed everyone’s expectations simply by waiting to see what the trends are and mimicking that."
@IaianArchibald I think most people would be shocked and amazed if governments simply adopted common sense solutions before they were outdated.
"@IaianArchibald On the other hand, if we were to adopt the approach of letting the private sector solve all of the public problems government can’t, how does access to be solutions remain equitable?"
It wasn’t a choice. https://t.co/QkMJjgTAep
"@PhillCurley @WayeMason @DartmouthDerek @hotspot_parking @hfxgov @LindellSmithHFX Thanks for weighing in. It makes perfect sense to me, from the entrepreneur’s perspective. I have no beef with hotspot, and as someone who appreciates a good app, I like the convenient and easy to use interface. If the problem you were solving was doggy daycare, I’d be quiet."
"@PhillCurley @WayeMason @DartmouthDerek @hotspot_parking @hfxgov @LindellSmithHFX The flaw, from the public interest perspective, is that your company has an interest in govt being slow to respond, innovate and for citizens to believe what you just articulated: that a small shop can innovate faster than an extremely well funded, massive bureaucracy."

"The legislation proposes a 25% +/- variance from the average electors per electoral district (huge, but unfortunately not out of the ordinary). And outlines the conditions for that variance to be exceeded."
Variance here means 'deviation above or below the estimated average number of electors per electoral district'
"The reasons for deviation from this 25% +/- figure may be justified ""because of geography.. historical, cultural or linguistic settlement patterns and because of political boundaries"""
With all of these terms being defined by a government dominated committee of the legislature.
"Judging from an early leak of the bill in an All NS story, the broadness of the language might be used not just to product African NS'n and Acadian NS'n communities, but communities that are simply shrinking due to urbanization."
"Also, the commission could consider 'political boundaries' in order to exceed the average +/- 25% variance."
"For context, using the 2011 numbers:

Average Electoral District Size: 13,952 voters per district
Allowable High: 17,440 voters per district
Allowable Low: 10,464 voters per district"
"When districts are allowed to vary by more than 29%, you have situations where one district can (legally) have twice the number of voters as of another."
"@gshotwell For African NS, and Acadian Communities, yes. But this looks like it's going beyond that (an All NS story suggested that it was also going to be used to allow shrinking parts of the province to maintain their representation)."
Also - the bill is here: https://t.co/FQt8Do0ZOD
"For clarity: I get that this is the government's response to the court challenge by the Acadian Federation, and that it will likely be used to re-create protected seats for the Acadian and African NS communities. And that part makes good sense."
"My concern: if that's all this bill was for, the language would look different. As written the terms in the bill are undefined, but will BY LAW be defined by a ctte of the govt to determine a very broad range of circumstances under which a small protected district can be created."
That's my first read. Smarter people who know more things than me: what is your take?

"@SpringtideCo Majority Rules?

Just 14 candidates were elected with a majority of votes in their riding. 35 candidates were elected with less than a majority of support (more people voted for losing candidates than for the winning one). #nbpoli #cdnpoli"
"@SpringtideCo Biggest Loser?

Wilfred Roussel lost the riding of Shippagan-Lamèque-Miscou by 99 votes. He collected 3,949 votes of his own to Robert Gauvin's 4048.

That’s more votes than any other losing candidate, and more votes than 35 of the *elected* candidates. #nbpoli #cdnpoli"
"@SpringtideCo Smallest Winner?

Gary Lowe won the riding of Saint John Harbour with 1,865 votes. That’s fewer votes than any other elected candidate, and fewer votes than 32 of the losing candidates. #nbpoli #cdnpoli"

"This is completely wrong. In PR, unlike FPTP, to hold power you have to get a majority of the seats, and to get a majority of the seats you have to get a majority of the vote. PR doesn’t mean the end of majority governments — it’s the beginning. /1 https://t.co/t99MFoVPhS"
"Minority govts (FPTP) are unstable because it only takes a swing of a few points in the popular vote to make a major change in seats.
So everyones’s got their finger on the button the whole time: whoever’s up in the polls is looking for any excuse to trigger an election. /4"
"Whereas under PR, there’s no such “leverage”: a small change in the vote for each party only means a small change in the number of seats it gets. So there’s no point in triggering a snap election. Instead, people get on with governing. /5"
"The failings of first-past-the-post go deeper than parties earning a significantly smaller (or larger) share of seats in the legislature than their share of the popular vote. That’s just the beginning.

I think there's a culture of risk-aversion in bureacracies that often gets labeled conservative that's not the same as strict-fatherism (which I guess is a willed ideology)"
"@LachlanMacKinn @Medium And then a similar culture of 'change for change's sake' in people working from the outside, that can be either progressive or conservative by Lakoff's definitions."

Don't let this slip by. Don't ignore a woman of colour leaving @cndpoli at least in part because of the impact on her family and the threats to her safety. Don't let this roll off us as business as usual. This is #notthecost of politics. This is not how we get better governance.

"It's not that we don't have many complex problems to solve, but there's so little evidence of government's ability to solve even the complicated problems that remain, you've got to wonder about why someone would trust the ability of government actors to solve the complex ones."
"All that to say, if governments want to he taken seriously when they decide to hold public engagements, it would be helpful to have, say, a decade of evidence based policy leadership to show that they're serious about follow through, and not just conducting a PR exercise."

"@MrSteveTweedale Yes. And, I'd be willing to bet that - from the government's perspective - the leak was definitely supposed to be released today."
@ashleyjmorton I didn't forget... but every national news outlet is leading with climate change and carbon tax stories. Any PR person worth their salt should have known this.
It is remarkable that we've been in symbiotic relationships with our phones for a decade+ and so few recordings between government offiicals have been leaked. https://t.co/GVlnsuUo61
@nssaltfarmer Ha!
Carbon taxes are so utterly banal that we shouldn't be fighting over whether or not to have one -- we should be fighting about whether or not the one we have is aggressive enough to deliver the results we need.
"@DevonRowcliffe I will bet you the opposite on that. Rathegeber's name wasn't written up in front page headlines for nearly two months before he left caucus.

"For instance, it's possible for a card carrying g Liberal or MP to be glad JWR and JP are out of caucus, and deeply disappointed that fair process *and the rule of law* were not followed in their removal. You're allowed to hold both of those sentiments at the same time!"
"Interesting observation by those attending the Equal Voice reception last night for 338 young women in town for a Daughters of the Vote events. There was a 20-minute lineup for photos with @Puglaas, Not so much for anybody else."
@AllyGarbs Adorable.
@DevonRowcliffe Perhaps - I don't know the riding well enough. I stilm can't see how the last two months would do anything but help her chances. I think I'd be more worried if I were a Liberal running in a riding that usually goes NDP or Tory (e.g. Halifax).
"But leaking confidential about the selection of Supreme Court judges to discredit @Puglaas, to the point where a judge had to disclose personal details about his wife's serious illness to counteract Liberal sleaze a-ok. according to Liberals.

I tried hard to persuade Michael Chong to stay in Cabinet and was disappointed when he opted to leave. But I never even considered that he would be forced out of caucus.
"I just wish more people on Twitter would make bold, sweeping declarations about what it all means."
The only downside to Daughters of the Vote is that it makes nearly everything else that happens in the House of Commons seem that much more depressing by comparison.

#cdnpoli #peipoli https://t.co/acgmAWrWa1"
If he didn't intend to resign (though it appears he will) he'd get first shot at forming a government and asking MLAs for their confidence. He even has this right despite not having won his own seat. Premiers don't *need* to be MLAs though they almost always are.
"In Westminster systems of government, voters don't elect the executive (Premier and Cabinet). We elect lawmakers, in this case, MLAs. As of right now, @WadeMacLauchlan remains the Premier. He remains Premier until he delivers his resignation to the Lieutenant Governor."
"Responsible journalism would involve calling this a 'hung legislature'. If you don't like that term because it's jargony, fine. Just explain to viewers why you can't tell them what their government will look like. Here's why:"
"Since @WadeMacLauchlan will likely resign, the LG must decide who gets the first chance to form a government, meet the legislature with a Throne Speech, and attempt to earn their confidence. If a majority of MLAs support the government presented to them, that's the government."
A minority government could simply be a single party working to earn votes for their legislation everytime they bring a bill forward. Or it could involve a confidence and supply agreement where a party that isn't in government agrees to support the one that is on confidence votes
"At this point, the government could be:
- A minority government
- A coalition government"
A coalition government would involve two (or more) parties forming a cabinet made up of members from two or more parties.
"So, to review. For now, it's a hung legislature. In the coming weeks, it may become clear that it's a minority government, or a coalition government. But right now, nobody knows what it will be. So it's a hung legislature."

"Meanwhile, the premier of Saskatchewan is happy to consider #PEI a new ally in the fight against Ottawa's carbon pricing plan: https://t.co/qvxaZ6Nw1R"
A few pieces to unpack from this morning's story: a carbon price of $50 / tonne in 2022 would cost Island households an average of $788 / year according to figures tabled in Parliament this spring. At $20 / tonne in 2019 that would be $315 per year. .... #peipoli
"But the economist who calculated those figures at U of Calgary says #PEI's costs would likely be somewhat higher, because this doesn't factor in carbon costs of electricity PEI imports from NB."
"With regards to assertions from #PEI's premier and environment minister it is implementing a price on carbon by lowering the HST on part of your electricity bill (to more closely match the lower tax on heating oil), the Pembina Institute says that's not a carbon price. #peipoli"
"Also, from FOIPP request: ""#PEI's climate change secretariat advised government in 2015 that the policy of taxing home heating oil at a lower rate than other energy sources ""created incentives for fossil fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions"" ..."
"...at the expense of ""other less carbon intensive heating sources (e.g. electricity, wood)."" So basically the opposite of a price on carbon. A discount on carbon, is what PEI has been offering since 2013. #peipoli"
"#PEI's emissions reduction plan may be ""convert a bunch of people from oil to electricity,"" which would indeed reduce emissions, but the effect would appear even greater because almost all the carbon emissions for the electricity #PEI uses are counted against NB. #peipoli"

"What the media release didn't state is that there are approx. 380 applications remaining in the queue. Despite the fact 10 will be drawn on Sept 20, govt says all 380 applications will be processed. I assume that means more applicants will be nominated beyond those 10. #peipoli"

"@a7thminor PEI has been taxing oil at a lower rate than electricity (until this year, much lower: 5 vs 15%). This has been like the opposite of a carbon tax, encouraging residents to use the heating source that causes the most pollution."
@a7thminor Govt has been told as much by its climate change secretariat. A reduction in the rate you pay on the 1st block of your electric bill has brought them closer but oil still has the advantage. A carbon tax would flip that around.

And here’s another request for school capital funding. This time it’s Allen Roach making a pitch with regards to Montague Consolidated. Jordan Brown says there is some work that needs to be done there. Roach asking about the “dated layout” of the school and need for a replacement
Just to be clear: the speaker said Mundy went two minutes over in her response. My observation was that it was reiterating points from the anti-poverty strategy.

"We’re now talking about the transportation of not just people, but sewage across the bridge. #peipoli"
"We/ve been strengthening the bridge so it can accommodate new walking lane, as well as sewage line, says minister. Stratford recently said tenders for the first phase of project to ship sewage to Ch’town came in well over budget. #peipoli"

As I tweeted earlier, the numbers are very “round” compared to other budget figs. #peipoli https://t.co/1DX3ZFdzfE"
I just have to wonder if there’s more progress / firmer planning behind the higher-precision figures in the budget.
"QP is over. Here’s finance minister @CornwallHeath talking about increase to basic personal exemption. This time he explains govt had committed to $1,000 increase over 2 years, but that is now “accelerated &amp; retroactive” to Jan 1 2018. At first govt called it a “new” increase."
MacDonald announced a decrease in the gas tax. Didn’t catch the figures. I assume we have to calculate this against the carbon tax Ottawa required #PEI to bring in. I didn’t hear him mention that one. #peipoli
"I just don’t understand why they didn’t announce this as what it really is: an acceleration of a previous plan to increase the basic personal amount by $1,000 over two years. That’s a good announcement. Why try to pretend this is over-and-above the commitment made in 2018 budget?"
Hannah Bell asks that next increase in basic personal amount be targetted at those most in need. Nova Scotia has a higher basic personal exemption for people with low income. The exemption scales down as incomes go up. I assume that’s the kind of thing she’s asking for #peipoli
Education Minister running down govt grants available for people who want to create childcare centres in their homes. Regulations were recently changed to increase how many kids can be cared for in-home. (Was it from 6 to 8?) #peipoli

"Because everything touted as ""new"" lately by govt, I feel an increased need to scrutinize. There were previously capital grants available for home-based childcare centres, looks like they were up to $10k bldg, $6k equipment (now $15k total), not sure if criteria have changed..."
It may be criteria or overall funding has changed. This may be a whole new program. I'm just doubly sceptical lately. Also there were already training and programming grants. Here's a link to some of them: https://t.co/AnbPxc4Gpi #peipoli
Perhaps it's a new round of funding to renew a previous program. I would just like them to tout it as such.
"@kerrywcampbell @NHL94_ @PeiPflag @PJPsych As Hon. James Aylward said yesterday in the legislature, it is great that Minister Mitchell has confirmed that Health PEI has never done this, but private organizations do. So I will be pushing for legislation."
Government says these are new grants with new funding meant to increase the number of home-based childcare centres. But there were previous grants which appear to have been available for this. However they were also open to non-home-based centres.

"(If only govt had a pool of money set aside somewhere, a surplus or stash to pay for things like this.)"

"Kudos to @NicoleatCBC--on her first solo day @peileg, realizing significance of rare procedural move used by Lib members of House to prevent debate on Green bill to make chief electoral officer, instead of cabinet, responsible for appointing district returning officers. #peipoli"
"This has now been recommended by 2 chief electoral officers. @casey_kathleen argued Greens disrespecting Legislative Mgmt C'tee, saying this amendment should come from it. But in fact premier already assigned Special C'tee on Democratic Renewal with responsibilty for these recs."
"But that never happened. Instead, as c'tee member @sidneymacewen would love to tell you but can't because confidentiality, that committee was shut down. Among the recommendations from the chief electoral officer still not addressed: getting rid of coin tosses. #peipoli"
So the procedure govt invoked last night has been used twice by the Greens. It basically begins a debate on the principles of a bill before second reading debate on the bill itself. Greens have used this on Referendum Act and current gas tax amendment.... #peipoli
"The difference is when the Greens did this, it was a preamble to debate on the actual bills. Government used the procedure last night to prevent second reading debate on the Green bill. #peipoli"
"Again, this was a bill to implement a recommendation that's now been put forward by 2 chief electoral officers: to take politics out of the appointment of district returning officers (which have been appointments for like) by making Elections PEI responsible, not cabinet #peipoli"
"@jbgreenan @NicoleatCBC @peileg The motion to move to second reading was defeated, and so the bill did not receive second reading. Were the Greens supposed to debate the bill then during the debate to move to second reading invoked by Casey? They were perhaps not prepared."

"So while there was relief among the Zhong family that this case is over for now, neither the siblings nor their attorneys are happy about the way the case ended -- with a stay as opposed to presenting their motion to dismiss or receiving a not guilty verdict. #pei #peipoli"

#PEI pump prices are well under a dollar today thanks to a 2-cent drop in prices and a temporary 3.4-cent drop in gas taxes. Although a govt media release yesterday made no mention of taxes going back up 4.4 cents on April 1. #peipoli
"""Islanders will pay less in taxes this year due to decreases in taxes on gas and diesel,"" the release says. This is not the way feds intended carbon pricing to work, but so far they seem to have turned a blind eye to #PEI. Not so with #NB."
"“Islanders are working hard and our province’s financial position means we can pass the benefits of our strong economy back to Islanders,” said Finance Minister Heath MacDonald."

@hannahbethbell @kerrywcampbell Being live streamed on @DennyKing7 facebook page
"First Q: How to provide health care to all parts of #PEI. But before Sarah Stewart-Clark can begin, request from the back of the room for her to stand up. She can’t. Emcee cites a podium shortage on #PEI. And I gather from what he said it was Pat Binns who spoke up. #peipoli"
"About 200 ppl now here. The candidates are not on the stage so you can see how someone, even a former premier might be wanting better sight lines. #peipoli https://t.co/OuKZwD1W9c"
"Q2 is on access to high-speed internet. King talks about implementing a plan within 18 months of coming to office. Dale says that’s too long a time frame, have to “light it up” right away. Govt has been giving the “illusion” of creating solutions, says Stewart-Clark... #peipoli"
"Both Arsenault and Driscoll mention #PEI govt’s contract with Bell, &amp; the fact former premier now works with the telcomm industry. #peipoli"
"Q3 and we’re onto amalgamation. “The process sucked,” says Dennis King of 3 Rivers. Arsenault says he agrees with King, and didn’t think he’d be saying this tonight. Dale: we took voices away from communities. I believe the question was “do you support forced amalgamation...”"
Stewart-Clark: we need to ensure all communities are respected. Driscoll: a PC govt led by him would scrap municipalities act and start over. #peipoli
"All 5 candidates for PC leader say they’re against forced amalgamation, which is, uh... not a huge surprise. Arsenault: is there a way we can do this to make communities vibrant without their having to amalgamate? Dale: we keep adding layers of bureaucracy. #peipoli"
"Amalgamation process undermined our democracy, says Stewart-Clark. Voices were shut down. Driscoll: adding the burden of more red tape to small communities isn’t the way to go. #peipoli"
"Q4 is on Northern Pulp, &amp; how to balance development vs. conservation. Arsenault: just because we have an ocean to dump stuff in doesn’t mean we should. Dale: it’s beyond me why they can’t come up with a solution rather than dumping effluent in strait. Gotta stop this. #peipoli"
"We need more scientists at the policy level, says Stewart-Clark. Corporations are producing “pseudo-science” pushing for solutions in their own interest, she says. Until Northern Pulp says they’ve done studies with lobster larvae, there should be no dumping in the strait #peipoli"
Driscoll says if the PM comes here he won’t be writing him a letter (as Wade MacLauchlan has done) he’ll be telling him Northern Pulp needs a federal environmental assessment. King: If I were premier I would use every legal lever I could use to fight this. #peipoli
"Arsenault criticizes MacLauchlan’s approach, writing letters to feds asking for federal assessment. Premier should be on the shoreline with media, making a national issue of this, he says. Driscoll: this is NS premier’s fault for pushing ahead timeline for Northern Pulp 10 years."
"First submitted question, about attracting more youth to PCs. This party needs to change, says Dale. Show youth their issues are important. Stewart-Clark: we don’t need to change. Our values resonate with youth. Have to better communicate who we are, make all feel welcome"
"Driscoll: youth need meaningful employment. Good job so they can afford rent, stay with their families on #PEI. King: my view is vastly different. We have to face reality. Stop being angry, divisive. Stop the infighting. Tell ppl what we’re for. #peipoli"
"Arsenault: last 3 decades of partisan politics under both Libs and PCs has turned a lot of people off, he says. Need an end to corruption, self-serving governments. #peipoli"
"Another submitted question: this one about care for Island seniors. Stewart-Clark: help keep seniors at home as long as possible. Provide respite beds, more long-term care beds for those who need it. Driscoll: support families who provide support for loved ones. #peipoli"
"King says his mother’s biggest fear is, when she needs to move to a care home, she’ll have to leave Georgetown. Says she’s been to Cornwall 3 times in her life. Need support to keep seniors in their communities. #peipoli"
"Arsenault bring this back to the topic of corruption. Notes connections between premiers, current and former, and Medavie. Questions role of private corps in providing health care. #peipoli"
"Submitted question on land use &amp; land protection act — on premise spirit of the act is being broken. Need to enforce the act, says Driscoll. King: need a comprehensive review immediately. Arsenault: keep farms small... #peipoli"
... Dale: strike balance between big &amp; small farms. Stewart-Clark: independent mussel &amp; oyster growers being bought out by corporations. Govt needs backbone to stand up for residents. #peipoli
"Interesting contrast among candidates on why they should be leader: King talks about history with govt, winning elections (with Binns); Dale says “I am a clean slate.” #peipoli"
Submitted question on how to address climate change. Arsenault: doesn’t support a carbon tax. Supports govt’s current approach to fund energy projects. Dale: climate change is upon us. Renewable energy. Stewart-Clark: prepare for climate change. Don’t build where it will flood.
Driscoll agrees with Dale on potential to expand renewable energy. King talks about missing incentives for things like solar. Says carbon tax should be the last measure taken — says we may need it someday but it’s a punitive tax. #peipoli
"Short snapper on which candidates will run for a district nomination if they don’t win leadership. Stewart-Clark is already a candidate. Driscoll says he’s committed to running in D14. King: won’t commit. Says Dale also lives in D15 so if Dale wins, it’s complicated. #peipoli"
"Arsenault says he live in Sidney MacEwen’s district, and man. He can’t be beat. See what happens, Arsenault says. Dale says he didn’t know King was also in D15. And says that’s where he’d like to run. #peipoli"
@jillmacintyre These topics have not come up.
"5 #PEI PC leadership candidates, 2 hrs, quick takeaways:
Arsenault: Need to end govt corruption
Dale: Leadership, service. I am a clean slate
Driscoll: Shake up the party &amp; the province
King: Need to take a good look at ourselves
Stewart-Clark: Islanders have lost trust in govt"

"For anyone who was wondering about IRAC's methodology with regards to setting #PEI gas prices, this document went online before Christmas. https://t.co/RmosxDZvwM #peipoli"
"So there is a quantitative part of the process (a strict formula) and a ""qualitative"" component (adjustments based on IRAC's thoughts on factors like inventory reports, weather, geopolitics), thru which the price from the formula can be adjusted by IRAC's petroleum panel #peipoli"
"All Atlantic provinces have price controls on fuel. Only #PEI allows these ""qualitative"" adjustments to prices to be made. The other provinces adhere to a strict formula. And as the AG reported, their formulae are public. Until the week before Christmas, PEI's was not. #peipoli"
"In that document I linked to, IRAC says ""at most price settings the price is set only by the reference to the calculated average numbers provided by the database model,"" that is, without adjusting for those other factors like weather, oil inventories and geopolitics... #peipoli"
"However, the AG didn't see it that way: ""In most of the pricing decisions we examined ... the petroleum panel made an additional adjustment to arrive at the final price. However, there was inadequate documentation"" on the specific factors which led to each price change. #peipoli"
"The AG found that many price adjustment announcements included an explanation such as ""due ti increased demand and restricted supply."" The AG says that doesn't cut it. She says the public should be provided with specific details on all factors influencing pricing decisions."

"@PattiDevine I don't think #PEI needs to be treated like a kid in the class that'll never amount to much, so gets a participation award. We're a province of Canada. On this issue, #PEI said it can reduce emissions with no carbon tax. In fact we just dropped gas taxes...."
@PattiDevine Climate change is real (and we are an island). Every government of every jurisdiction in the world should be held accountable for how they address this issue. Measuring emissions is how we do that. If they go down (they actually increased in 2016) it will be reported.
"@stevenmyersPC @PattiDevine I'm in favour of holding the government of the day to account over whatever plan they have, or don't have as the case may be, to address climate change.

I believe there are two key polls coming up which could influence whether we see an election this spring. This is one of them. #peipoli https://t.co/61nqBkfbdY
"#PEI govt release announcing new children's commissioner &amp; advocate listed several reports it said led to new position--no mention of Campbell/Hennessy inquest. Minister of Family Services ""pleased to see another recommendation of Poverty Reduction Action Plan come to fruition"" https://t.co/MBn9chaEbv"
"The release says the creation of children's commissioner &amp; advocate follows recommendations from the #PEI children's report, child protection act review (which bent over backwards to avoid the term ""child advocate"") and the poverty reduction action plan. ..."
Again no mention of Campbell / Hennessey or the jury's recommendation. It's like an alternate history timeline of the push for a child advocate. The oversight really only makes sense if you remove the word 'advocate' and just call it a 'children's commissioner.'
"It may just be government hoping people forget all the times since 2015 they said a child advocate wasn't necessary, or to try to take credit away from the opposition parties who pushed for it. ... #peipoli"
"...This has also been a govt, as when we thought the premier laid out plans for a carbon tax in 2016, that doesn't seem to like to walk things back, to publicly say it's had to reconsider and has changed its mind on something. So maybe that."
Or maybe just wanting to move forward without mentioning that much of the push for a child advocate on #PEI came from this tragedy. Seems more likely that in a media release they just want to make it look like it was their idea. But don't people pay more attention than that?
@jbgreenan There seemed to be some wordplay at work to relay what people were asking for (a child advocate apparently) without using the phrase ‘child advocate.’
"I’m at a meeting of #PEI’s referendum commissioner, who’s about to explain the upcoming vote on our electoral system. Oh but this takes me back to one of my first evening assignments for the CBC... same topic, back in 2005...? #peipoli"
I believe Leonard Russell was the speaker at that meeting. He started explaining mixed-member proportional representation by explaining the d’Hondt calculator. Not sure it was the easiest entry point into the topic. #peipoli
"Referendum Commissioner Gerard Mitchell explaining MMP and the vote. This is meeting 5 for him, he said it's the biggest crowd so far. 50-60 here, including perhaps a disproportionate # of politicos / candidates. #peipoli https://t.co/4xVtI0euKu"
"They're passing around this giant sample ballot, which is a pretty good prop. Biggest (only?) change in This MMP model vs. 2005 is this time it's an open list. Thus all the names on the bottom half of this (oversize) ballot. #peipoli https://t.co/6JaStPXbQb"
So the way the vote would work for this MMP model — you choose a candidate from your district from the 5 names (in this example) on the top part of the ballot — then choose one of the (maybe 40) names from the party lists on the bottom part of the ballot. #peipoli
"Most of the questions are around the lists — how the parties populate them, how people on the lists get seats. Mitchell clarifies that, if a party gets a list seat, it goes to the list candidate who got the most votes, regardless of the order they appear on the list. #peipoli"
"How would parties populate their lists? As they do now, Mitchell says, the parties would likely include that process in their constitutions. It wouldn’t likely be in the Elections Act (I don’t think it is now). #peipoli"
"A question veers off into “what the Liberals will do” with results of the referendum. “I’m not going there!” says Mitchell, to laughs. #peipoli"
"A number of questions about the terms that were set by govt in legislation for the results of the referendum to be considered binding: 50% of the vote, but also a majority in 60% of the Island’s 27 districts. Mitchell says that works out to 17 districts. #peipoli"
"Here Mitchell says the referendum vote is binding, but not binding. The legislation says the results are binding, but Mitchell explains the new government could decide to change the legislation. (And he’s a retired justice so....) #peipoli"
A few people with questions don’t seem to like the 60% of districts threshold for the results to be considered binding. Last questioner said that threshold is unfair. #peipoli
"The first way govt presented the legislation, the percentage of referendum votes was measured not against not the number of people who voted in the referendum, but who voted in the election. So not voting in referendum would effectively be the same as voting “no.” That changed."

"Mar Elec had applied for an increase of roughly 1.3% for residential customers which would have kicked in tomorrow. Overall, asked for 4.1% increase over 3 years. Also applied for change in residential rate structure, expanding 1st block billing from 2k to 5k kWh."

For background: we’re coming up on the five-year anniversary of former MLA Janice Sherry telling the legislature the province needs an all-encompassing water act: https://t.co/RA5CgRtoVA #peipoli
"The Water Act itself was passed on Dec. 20, 2017 and has received Royal Assent. But it has never been enacted. We’ve been waiting for development of the accompanying regulations. #peipoli"

It was a call for a moratorium on new high-capacity wells for irrigation to be lifted that started us along this road all those years ago.
Brad Trivers and Peter Bevan-Baker are both asking questions / expressing concerns about holding ponds. Bevan-Baker asking whether homeowners are having more difficulty obtaining well water based on their proximity to holding ponds. Govt folks say they know of 2 examples.
"George Somers, manager of drinking water &amp; wastewater mgmt for the province mentioned there have been instances were holding ponds used in place of high-capacity wells under the moratorium. #peipoli"
"I haven’t heard anything at this committee meeting, and I see nothing in the govt media release that just went out on #PEI’s Water Act, to suggest parts of the act will come online as these regulations are introduced. So we’ll have to ask about that. #peipoli"

Okay. #PEI’s manager of drinking water and wastewater mgmt just said the water withdrawal regulations are ready to go. But someone (he said it’s not his call on this) decided these two sets of regulations were enough to go with for now. #peipoli
George Somers with the Dept of Environment keeps saying these two sets of regulations don’t change much — most of this was already in place. It seems to me the extraction regulations are the critical piece here. He said those are done. But those aren’t being presented yet.
"Somers said he thought the extraction regulations those could be presented in a couple months, but said it’s not his call. Now Richard Brown is talking about next fall. About waiting for more science. #peipoli"

So 202 decided voters not out of line with what they've used before. Aug 2018 = 213. But 6.9% still a big margin.
"@PEIConnor It's not actually smaller than what they usually use. 300 is normal for them although recently they've bumped some to 600. Within that, there are always somewhere around one-third who are undecided etc. Aug 2018, the number of decided voters was 213."

Some background on housing in this campaign: https://t.co/5y0mtaztU7 #peipoli
Not a lot of movement from these leaders during the debate portion to jump in on each other. Here’s Bevan-Baker calling for new regulations for short-term rentals. And a review of residential properties act (which is already happening to some degree). #peipoli
"Q4 What makes you best choice for premier? Byrne: lifetime spend in community advocacy. King: I’m very human, I understand people. Bevan-Baker: Bruce asked this 4 years ago, I said I wasn’t sure I was. Now changed mind. MacLauchlan: I care about province, track record of teamwork"
"Q5 On moratorium on high-capacity wells for irrigation. King: Keep the moratorium, expand it to regular wells used to fill holding ponds. Bevan-Baker: we need to proclaim water act. MacLauchlan: moratorium in place since 2003, no reason for that to change. ... #peipoli"
"Byrne: maintain the moratorium, also develop a public database of wells so people know how water is being used. King jumps into debate portion, brings up issue of (lack of) organic matter in #PEI soil. #peipoli"
"That time a standing committee was told in the lead-up to this election that water extraction regulations (including govt’s plan for high capacity wells) are completed, but were not included with other draft regulations put out for public consultation: https://t.co/H1TtNfyoc3"
"So this debate could have been about the regulations which have already been developed showing how govt plans to deal with the issue of water extraction, but those were not released to the public. #peipoli"
"Q6 starts with estimate #PEI will have highest economic growth in Canada this year. How will parties ensure those benefits reach Islanders living in poverty. A huge disconnect between health of economy &amp; health of people, says Bevan-Baker, says it’s not just here... #peipoli"
"MacLauchlan making the case (he’s done this before) that all Islanders are benefitting from economic boom, and highlighting new tax measures to increase that. And again, gets applause from Dennis King for that.... #peipoli"
"Pay a livable wage, says Byrne. We ask people to live and work in poverty. All parties proposing increase in minimum wage I think. Byrne says NDP plan is immediate increase to $15? I think they’re plan is a bit more gradual... #peipoli"
"Put more money in the hands of Islanders, says King. PCs would increase basic personal tax exemption from $9100 to $12,000, he says. #peipoli"
Byrne brings up federal funding for Loblaws fridges. I wonder how much federal Liberal woes might be affecting #PEI’s campaign? One experienced local candidate told me SNC Lavelin was definitely having an effect. #peipoli
"That felt like a solid blow from Bevan-Baker on MacLauchlan, saying govt amassed a magical $75M surplus that came from nowhere, while he says social programs were underfunded. A fiesty exchange between them. MacLauchlan stays on his feet &amp; strikes back. #peipoli"
Byrne brings up #PEI’s 2 EI zones. Which our 4 federal MPs vowed to turn back into one zone. (One of those MPs has since recanted). Strikes me how #peipoli could be a fun drinking game. #peipoli
"Q7 Do you support MMP? It starts with MacLauchlan which leads to oohs or hisses or something from the audience. MacLauchlan says Islanders will speak, politicians should stay out. (He told Compass once PR would lead to minority govts in perpetuity, and that was clearly bad)."
"Byrne points to these four white men on stage (including himself) and says #peipoli needs more diversity. We have 3 leaders on the record (NDP, PC, Green) supporting changing our electoral system to MMP which is quite something. #peipoli"
Q8 is on PNP: what further changes would you make to immigration programs? King says #PEI has done a very good job in recent years attracting new Cdns. (Take a moment to compare that with any given day in #PEI legislature &amp; PC questions on PNP. This is a very different tone).
"MacLauchlan is the only one who picks up on the shutdown of the entrepreneur stream of PNP, mentions how #PEI relying on 5 other streams. Byrne on allowing more temporary foreign workers to stay: if you’re good enough to work here, you’re good enough to live here. #peipoli"
I was thinking on the drive in how much pressure is on these four leaders to perform tonight. I think everyone is doing well. Folks will pick their winners. Hope there’s time to get into several more issues before time is up. #peipoli
"In addition to choosing a government on April 23, Islanders will vote in a referendum on electoral reform. A primer: https://t.co/y2kLc5uY9N https://t.co/bpBHronXlu"
"Our retention rate is pitiful, says Bevan-Baker, ending the love-in. Need to make sure required services are there for new Islanders and #PEI has failed in that. Low retention rate is folklore, says MacLauchlan. Old numbers (I’d like to see his new #s. We’ve heard this for years)"
"Carbon tax question: will you maintain it? Change it? King says it’s a punative tax, says adding to gas prices just makes it more difficult to drive, and there’s no other way to move around on #PEI. No other options. #peipoli"
"King says he would work with Ottawa on “made-in-#PEI” solution, which is exactly what MacLauchlan said he would do. #PEI ended up with a 1c carbon tax which, compared to 4.4 c in NB et. al, well... #peipoli"
"Bevan-Baker says govts aren’t here to make everybody happy. Talks about leaving a livable planet for our children &amp; grandchildren. Says carbon tax most efficient way to reduce emissions. MacLauchlan notes his made-in#PEI solution, which kept carbon tax off heating oil (&amp; propane)"
(I’ve occasionally wondered but never asked: why was propane exempted from carbon tax on #PEI) Joe Byrne says he doesn’t believe the market can fix this. NDP proposing carbon tax revenues go to major public works projects to reduce emissions. #peipoli
"Bevan-Baker calls #PEI Liberal approach to carbon pricing “gratuitiously stupid,” quoting a local economist. Says it won’t reduce emissions. It’s him and King debating this, and now Byrne. MacLauchlan staying out of all this. #peipoli"
"MacLauchlan suggests someone is calling the 4000 Islanders who switched to heat pumps gratuitiously stupid. Mentions using carbon tax revenues to give everyone free drivers licences, and says that what a government is supposed to do. #peipoli"
And the question / debate portion ends on a bit of a bang there. Closing statements. Curious what folks thought. I’m thinking partisans saw whatever they were looking for. Any undecideds coming out of this with a better idea on how to vote? #peipoli
"I think Bevan-Baker scored on MacLauchlan on the $75M surplus versus social services spending, and King may have won some support questioning Greens on carbon tax (and standing up for the Liberal approach. What times these are in #peipoli!)"
A good debate. Some fiesty moments but for the most part very civil. The nice-off that is #peivotes2019 continues. #peipoli

"9 in cabinet leaves 3 in PC backbench. 1 will be house leader, another whip, and then there's the issue of speaker of the house."

1. Some final #YDAYPEI thoughts (would also love to hear your thoughts):
2. This year was another great chance to gain insights from other youth leaders. Glad I’m still learning from their experiences.
3. We’re very fortunate to have some bright people on PEI who really care about their province. They’re special people.
"4. Throughout the day we heard about a plethora of issues, but many of them were also raised last year."
"5. It was often unclear what, if anything, had been done to address them since then."
"6. As much as I want to be optimistic about youth issues, I still feel like that’s an untenable position."
7. 6 months ago we heard MLAs from both major parties argue against lowering the voting age. https://t.co/iZOLv1qYv8
"8. The rhetoric from this discussion framed youth in negative terms: youth drinking, criminal activity, and disorganization being examples."
"9. Government-sponsored youth advisory bodies have appeared, both municipally and provincially."
10. But when was the last time either body that represents me held an open nomination process for new members?
11. I believe in the value of civic engagement and participating in government consultations.
"12. I also want to believe youth engagement initiatives are important. But when results are hard to see, when MLAs set a poor tone..."
"13. ...and when advisory bodies don’t feel accessible, it’s tough not to question how valuable any of this youth engagement stuff really is."

1) A few thoughts/observations from this great article on the upcoming by-election in District 11 #peipoli https://t.co/nBXaAy5Kcu
"2)A Candidate’s preference for social media appears to be directly proportional to their regular use of social media platforms. Some dislike stems from potential for misunderstandings. Personally, I’d argue that it’s the best way to meticulously craft and articulate your message."
"3) Social media is viewed by some as a replacement for face-to-face contact rather than a complement. They’re right that door-to-door won’t go away, but social media is big for those on the go and especially youth. An @ is better engagement than a flyer."
"4) The youth* issues each candidate chose to highlight align more or less with those their party has been promoting. I’m not sure if it’s a confirmation bias or a conscious, subtle plug for their platform but it’s fascinating regardless."
5) UNRELATED BUT @YoungVotersPEI is hosting an all-candidates forum at 6:30pm on Thursday at bar1911 and it's going to be GREAT. SEE YOU THERE. #peipoli

"1. Maybe I'm missing something, but the argument that minimum wage increases hurt businesses because businesses must maintain competitive prices doesn’t do much for me. https://t.co/tmIX5zoGoI"
"2. “Competitive prices” are relative. If your business operates locally, you’re competing against companies with the same imposed wage requirements. All else being equal, you’re still on even footing with them. Adjust prices if needed."
3. The argument might make sense if they mean companies competing against those in jurisdictions w/ a lower min. wage – but I’d also suspect that if you’re doing cross-border biz you’re probably already paying staff above min. wage.

1) If I can air one major annoyance I have with government right now it's the fact that there are virtually no policy recommendations by youth reflected in the govt's mandate letters. #peipoli https://t.co/vCHW2yCBNJ
2) What’s especially frustrating is that youth have continuously highlighted a variety of issues but you would be hard-pressed to find an acknowledgement of them anywhere.
3) No references to creating standards for sexual violence policies in postsecondary institutions on PEI (OTHER PROVINCES ARE DOING THIS! Example: can’t find Holland College policy online; would be illegal in Ontario)
"4) There’s no mention of working to get more students from lower-income backgrounds into postsecondary, even though the evidence shows PEI has been awful in this area. https://t.co/FDrDVs8DWU"
5) I had Indigenous students tell me last year that they faced discrimination by not receiving an Island bursary and were told it could be fixed if they could make a good argument for it. This is a demographic that already struggles to attain PSE as it is.
6) I’ve been thinking a lot lately about an op-ed I read the other day about a person's reasons for leaving the East Coast and I couldn’t even get mad at it. https://t.co/3tDE6ERqR4
"7) If there’s any reason I want to leave, it’s because I don’t get the impression that anyone wakes up thinking about the issues facing me and other youth."
8) I resent the fact that young people here constantly need to justify their existence and why government shouldn’t ignore them. THAT’S NOT HOW REPRESENTATION WORKS!!!
9) Writing a plan to retain young people? Cool. Here’s my advice for what to include:
10) Start honestly listening to young people and work to seriously address their issues. And learn to start caring more about young people while they’re here rather than after they’ve left. #peipoli

"@sentancej @kerrywcampbell Right. Provincially, George Coles isn't assessed on need but rather certain social conditions (i.e. attended an Island high school). Federal grants are based on family income with a low-income stream and a middle-income stream."
@sentancej @kerrywcampbell Rationale behind removing parental contributions is that it assumes that parents will make a contribution to their child's education which is not always the case. cc: @johnathanrix who might have more to say on it
"@sentancej @kerrywcampbell As far as I'm aware, aside from the George Coles bursary there's a debt-reduction grant but that's only accessible after the completion of a degree. PEI govt sometimes says there's $30M going to student aid for Islanders - but I think only $7-8M of that is provincial."

"@johnathanrix @cheron @sentancej @kerrywcampbell Personal story: when I considered a loan in 2nd year, my mom said to put whatever the govt formula said, but not to actually expect any financial support from her because it was outside of her means at the time (recently separated single mother)."
@johnathanrix @cheron @sentancej @kerrywcampbell Ultimately didn't go down the govt student loans road because of that. There's a difference between parents who ARE contributing to an education and parents who are being expected to contribute but who might have circumstances that prevent them from doing so.
"@cheron @johnathanrix @sentancej @kerrywcampbell Not sure how modifying amounts/%/cutoffs would properly deal with extraneous life circumstances though. But like John said, it's not a perfect policy. I doubt one could ever develop a perfect student fin. aid policy, but there are different ways to improve on what's in place now."

Re-tweeting this thread since it is relevant to today's events: https://t.co/gBcEmfcAa4
I'm still very unclear what councillors are not in favor of. Vague reference by a councillor to represent constituents
Councillors seem kinda off here. It appears like Policy committee can approve changes to policy (which would cut red tape) and changes would be brought to Council as information.
"Exec can't wantonly modify policies, only that they have to be consulted on policy changes (which makes senses - they need to enforce policy). Councils can still amend policies afterwards (policy committee reports to Council). Classic SU council"
"Now something questionable - it appears the ombudsperson, the independent party establish by the SU to investigate complaints and issues within the SU, would be losing some jurisdiction over internal issues. Not sure how this meshes with SU's bylaws/constitution."
@JohnPloyer Whenever you’d fill out a nomination form you’d have the option to fill out a series of checkboxes about your background. SU would compile data and use it to address representation issues.
"The Cadre, UPEI's glorious free press, has access to the policy document under review but without the proposed changes. So we can't provide much analysis on it."
"So I just got the doc. But anyway, I'm so confused as to what tf is happening right now."
"Now, I'm not the president/a member of policy but... I would avoid bringing a one-hundred-and-eight page document to Council for a vote."

sO far lots of procedural shenanigans
SU has discussed doing a joint press release with the UPEI Faculty Association about their position on FOIPP. (The provincial government recently concluded an open submission process for the review of the FOIPP act.)
PEI is the only Canadian province where postsecondary institutions aren't covered under freedom of information legislation.
VPSL is absent and no report was uploaded.
VPF says draft 2018/19 budget will be brought to Council on March 25.
Justin Clory is now reading a letter about Love &amp; Sex Week on behalf of the UPEI Queer Collective. The group believes that Love &amp; Sex Week fell short of meeting its advertised diversity.
"Clory cites some specific examples, including prizes and a lapdance activity at Sex Trivia."
Clory suggests that the SU research campaigns and activities at other institutions. Also says SU should consider meeting with Queer Collective while planning the week in the future.
VPAX Taya Nabuurs apologizes for any hurt the week might have caused and said the executive committee will be discussing the issues.
"Clory says groups who were consulted felt like they were consulted for ""five minutes"" and consultations felt tokenistic."
Grad rep Ashley McKibbon says the issues were another example of the SU not doing the proper groundwork while planning events.
Council now discussing executive evaluations in camera. Council bylaws require the evaluations to be completed in January (amended from December earlier this year) but results only being discussed at the end of February.
"Executive evaluations are still being discussed, an hour and a half later.

Mood: https://t.co/Y59SwHn381"
We're back!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !!! !!!!!
Council is now reviewing policy book. Discussion about proposed policy change to allow the executive to amend policies during the summer via majority vote.
"Concerns at Council about allowing policy committee to approve changes to policy. Proposed action is to send proposed amendments being discussed back to policy committee, who was already accused of not addressing councillors' concerns the last time. wat"
"Motion passes to send it back, now onto disciplinary procedures policy."
"Of note, there are amendments proposed that would see aspects of the investigation of complaints move to the GM from the Ombudsperson, the SU's independent investigator."
"The amendments were approved. Spooky fact though: the SU's policy no longer requires the Ombudsperson to sit in on interviews relating to formal complaints - this is now the responsibility of the VPF and GM. No more council representation on the investigative team, either."
"That being said, Council's bylaws still allow the ombudsperson to attend ordinarily confidential meetings, including investigatory meetings. Not sure if the SU intends to actively keep them in the loop, though."
@ammyrix https://t.co/Pvf0j3Sggc
"Job descriptions policy approved to be eliminated, rationale being that job descriptions do not form a policy themselves."
"Council just approved a new external organization membership policy, which will govern terms/expectations when joining/partnering with a third party organization."
Proposed policy now that outlines what confidentiality agreements for staff would look like.
"Very concerning from a student media perspective. The Cadre's writers are considered SU employees, and would technically not be allowed to share (and by consequence report on) confidential documents that might come their way."
This would infringe on the journalistic responsibilities and editorial autonomy of The Cadre. I hope councillors articulate this point given that some of them learn about SU stuff from us before other channels in the organization.
Confidentiality policy will go back to committee for review.
@ferguson_mi Or the committee could actively solicit employee feedback instead of making unilateral decisions🙃
"Council is talking about a finance bylaw amendment and people are looking at me, which means there is confusion in the room!"
Amendment would remove requirement for a public meeting to present the budget within the first three weeks of classes. Will be viewed again at the next meeting.
BACK ON OUR BOOOOOOLLSHIT. Talking about making it harder to run for executive positions!
"Proposal to make it a requirement for 45 signatures to run for an executive position. To represent ~3800 students. To run as a MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT, you need 100 signatures. To represent 34.5k people."
Proposal is tabled until it hopefully dies a painful death at the next meeting.

Watching SU candidates make promises that would be literally impossible to implement and seeing students eat it up makes me very sad.
I used to get roasted on hard for having ideas and a clear A-B path to address certain issues. But at least I would take the time to talk to people and understand the issues.
There are so many people willing to talk with candidates and share their knowledge and experience on issues. It’s unbelievable then that candidates wouldn’t take the time to learn from them.
Candidates who talk out of their asses are dangerous for the SU because they won’t stop if they are elected.
Anyway brb punching a wall
"@ferguson_mi 1) I am unaware of any institution in the 🌎 that publishes course lists 1 year in advance, let alone 2.

"Neither are present, and Council is told that one of them is absent tonight because they are out to eat with their significant other for their birthday."
Both resignation letters are accepted by Council.
"Issues involved December graduates not being able to vote for grad class exec, students on exchange not being able to vote, and supplementary elections needed to be added for Senate and Business rep races."
"CRO Janna Ganesan is presenting her election report. Mainly smooth election, she says, aside from issues with the election platform."
Voter turnout was 21.2% - that's nearly half what it was when I was elected Dear Leader !!!
(How many councillors are still drunk from Beach Blast?)
President report is happening now.
New deadline for Inspiring Innovation Fund is March 16.
VPAX report now. Repeated that SU met recently with @RobMitchellMLA and @SonnyGallant about student mental health funding.
SU also discussed mental health funding with @sidneymacewen.
"VPSL report now. ""Beach Blast is OVER!"" says @meeganrix. Says ticket sales were ""good,"" unsure of final tally."
"Rix says she thinks she's found a cool act to play at the end of the year but needs to talk to a few people. (I don't know if that's related to the act's ""coolness."")"
"Council has devolved into a confusion about pizza. It's like a Socratic seminar in here, people trying to figure out what all this means."
Council moves in-camera for discussion of VP Finance hiring board recommendations.
Out of camera now. Council approves hiring board recommendation.
Council now discussing mental health initiatives fund. The Cadre has written about confusion about the future of the fund: https://t.co/NG12oEaOLQ
"The president is proposing implementing a health and wellness program through Aspiria. It would be funded with health plan reserves for the first year and would then go to referendum in the 2018-19 year, at a cost of $4.20 per year per student."
"@ammyrix asking why she was told different things about the mental health initiatives fund, says she ended up telling students things that weren't true because the SU circulated her things that were untrue."
"President responds by saying MHIF is short-term solution, whereas SU is looking for long-term initiatives, which she believes the wellness program is."
Important to remember though that the MHIF (Mental Health Initiative Fund) is a way for students themselves to try and make a difference on Campus. Why can't we have Aspiria and MHIF? https://t.co/NLFCQNuqW6
"Councillor @KawiKwuze asking why nothing happened with the fund and who was responsible. VPAX Nabuurs says it was under the president's portfolio and nothing was done, which is why it's being addressed now."
"2) People saying this was a one-time investment, but I'm struggling to find any record from 2015 (when the fund was launched) that the fund was to be discontinued when the fund ran out."
"Few personal thoughts on this:
1) I think the SU is being revisionist - I don't recall anyone ever saying UPEI would partner to provide financial support for the MHIF. Intent was either to use health plan reserves or fundraise for the fund."
"3) SU is being very optimistic that students will agree to a new fee. If they don't (and they kill the MHIF), then the SU is shooting itself in the foot in a sense. But anyway..."
"Someone just said that the SU health plan reserves have only $16k. I doubt that very, very much (unless something catastrophic has happened)."
A report on the health plan (including how much money is left in the reserves) is requested.
Another personal thought: what ever happened to that Shepell student support program we have/had?
"After a long in-camera session to discuss council/exec evaluations, we're back!"
"Council approved an amendment to require all SU employees to sign a confidentiality agreement, which obviously limits The Cadre's ability to provide great news coverage! Great job folks!"
"Because there are no special procedures for The Cadre's staff, I look forward to future iterations of the staff struggling to make the decision between reporting on an important SU story or keeping their job."
"Council now on elections bylaw, once again considering more stringent nomination rules. Exec candidates would require 45 signatures instead of 15, and would require signatures from five different faculties."
Reminder that you need 100 signatures to run for MP in Charlottetown (over 30k people)~
"Rationale for the proposal seems to be ""because other people are doing it"", ""it would allow pre-campaigning without pre-campaigning"", and it would show students that candidates are ""serious""."
Also the funny thing is that the SU just had one of it's worst voter turnouts and number of candidates in my entire time at UPEI and it wants to make it harder to run. Well thought-out.
Council passes amendment to change proposed number from 45 to 25.
@scottgrant37 what?
Motion to require 25 signatures and at least one from 5 different faculties to be approved as a candidate passes.
Not like there haven't been past upper-year SU executives who've possessed neither.
"Motion on the floor to send elections bylaw back to policy committee, purpose seeming to be whether the SU should allow first-year students to run for executive positions because executives need to have a good understanding of the SU and campus."
Also - there might be some legal restrictions associated with prohibiting members to run for their organization's executive.
Onto new business - Councillor McKibbon is proposing the creation of an HR committee. Says current structure for addressing HR is unilateral with most of the control resting with the VP Finance.
@liam_mckenna who are you casting as the lead?
Meeting is over - that was personally vexing.

@daniimacd @RosieOGravy I asked the ombudsperson to investigate who authored the letter after the chair declined to provide the names of the people involved. If I'm not mistaken she's also investigating the veracity of the allegations in the motion of non-confidence.
"@daniimacd @RosieOGravy The chair said it was sent by a group (so there was an implied mover and seconder, I guess) but no names were ever made available. I don't know how that affects its validity, but the motion was never moved at a meeting, in any case."
@RonnieMcPheePEI The SU's media release said it's policies require acceptance but I've found nothing in them to support that position. The only reference to resignations in the policies says it's a voluntary termination of employment.

"Ombudsperson determines that board representative Mike Ferguson, DVM rep Samantha Begin, and health &amp; wellness rep Amy Rix were the individuals involved in putting forward the motion of non-confidence."
"The ombudsperson is now addressing allegations. Allegation 1: disregard for rules, laws, and regulations."
"Ombudsperson says interviews with councillors revealed underage drinking, including vodka shots in the SU office, and being present in areas of the Wave that were 19+ (Perry is 18)."
"Allegation #3: inappropriate presence on certain social media platforms. Ombudsperons says they relate to a spam instagram account. Says account included at least one joke with racist undertones, negative posts about SU."
"Also councillors were critical of a post she had made in the council group that was ""passive-agressive."" (really?)"
"Allegation 5: unpleasant interactions with fellow councillors. At Perry's first council meeting, DVM rep Begin offered a handshake and Perry hugged her instead, which Begin felt was a disregard for personal boundaries."
"Only formal complaints against Perry: social media presence, and being present in the Wave when she was not allowed."

Looking at the livestream and OMG - at least two people voted no to investigate complaints of harassment by former president Ahmed: his roommate and another close friend.
"The Cadre has previously covered how his roommate did not excuse himself from the discussion of Ahmed's executive evaluation, despite both of them declaring their roomate status as a conflict at a previous meeting.

Will provided an update on former president Perry's resignation. Says the resignation was valid and that the SU can't impeach someone who no longer sits on their council.
McGuigan says the SU's legal counsel recommended an overhaul of the SU's governing documents.
Executive is seeking direction from council on how they would like resignations to be handled in the future. There is nothing on the topic in the SU's governing documents at the moment.
There is a motion (amendment pending) on the floor to have the policy committee to consider a policy amendment that would grant the ability to accept/reject resignations when someone is facing impeachment.
I have to wonder: what is the point? Presumably council would want the person in question out of the organization. Why would you potentially continue to go after them after they've already agreed to leave?
Motion for the policy committee review passes.
"Councillor Cairns asks about whether council is issue notices/motions of non-confidence anonymously. According to Nabuurs, the SU's legal counsel called the practice ""legally dubious."""
"Nabuurs presents clarification on what the investigation into VPSL's Rix claims would cover. Letter provided says it would look at a timeline, individuals involved in the HR complaint investigation, the result of the complaint process, and what information was provided to Rix."
Nabuurs now putting forward a motion to have a third party investigate the claims made by Rix. Motion raises a conflict of interest between the ombudsperson and former president Ahmed because they are friends.
"Nabuurs said a councillor had requested an external investigator, and the SU had also been advised by their legal counsel to purse a third party investigator."
"McGuigan has said there is no price tag at the moment for a third party investigation because they are unsure how big the investigation will be. If I heard correctly, funding would come from savings (or same fund that was used to support the new SU award endowment this year)."
Motion for a third party investigator passes. Onto a motion to have the SU's governing documents reviewed by a professional third party.
Ferguson asking why funding for the review can't be pulled from legal budget line. McGuigan says it will but adds he does not believe it would cover the full cost of the review.
Motion for the governing doc review passes. Council now moves in camera to discuss the director of communications hiring board recommendation.
Council is out of camera. Approves hiring board recommendations.
McGuigan is presenting a draft of the 2018-19 SU budget.
"First up: Director of Comms salary would double, with the DoC working full-time over the summer. (I hear echoes of the curse of the hired VP Comms...)"
McGuigan says CFS fee will be going up to $10. CASA fee stays at $4.
McGuigan says SU fee will not increase and will remain at $166.
Now off on a discussion to have certain students being able to opt out of certain on-campus fees. The discussion is once again devoid of any context.
"Fact-check on raising SU fees: It is true that Council can't raise fees ""willy nilly."" Council can vote to increase the fee by CPI. It can also increase the fee by greater than CPI, but it requires a substantial consultative process."
"""What has CFS done for us?""
""I can't speak to it."""
(The SU was recognized as a member of the CFS after a nearly decade-long legal battle)
"""Why are we members of the CFS if we don't use their services?""
""We're legally obligated to. I'll leave it at that."""
Back to the budget. Projected decrease in revenue from student housing ads and student centre rentals.
Student centre debt will increase from $30k to $86K to cover the cost of the student centre renovation loan.
Executive salaries recommended to increase by 1.6% for the 2018-19 year.
"Discussion now about increasing vice presidents' salaries to bring them in-line with the president's. Consensus seems to be that executives should be paid more, but that it is likely outside of the SU's financial capacity to boost pay across the board."
"@fahimhrahman @UNBSU We've lost sight of Our Lord. It is his day, Fahim."
Advocacy budget under the VPAX would decrease from $1500 to $750. Council told this is reflective of expenses this year.
New $750 budget line to send SU execs to CFS AGM.
"SU budgeting to spend $1,000 for election readiness. Down from $1500 the last time it was budgeted for."
"Policy and Research Coordinator pay to increase $1,300. Would now work 7 hours/week over the summer."
Councillor initiatives funding line would decrease from $2500 to $1900. McGuigan says there was not much interest from councillors for this funding.
@fahimhrahman @UNBSU @NBSA_AENB @herbertbempah lol why were they avoiding?
"No increases to society, AVC, undergrad, and graduate funding."
"VPSL's general events budget line will decrease from $50k to $45k. Graduate student programming increases from $3k to 5k, new international event funding line at $1.5k, first year even funding down from $1.5k to $1k."
Campaigns budget would decrease from $7.5k to $6.5k. VPSL Rix says campaigns are relatively inexpensive as they are.
"I will editorialize here and say that funding is NOT the problem with campaigns. Students largely do not give a shit about campaigns. And big speakers are super expensive, and nobody ever goes to see them when we do bring them in."
@ferguson_mi Don't need them because students don't give a shit.
VPSL says the reality of campaigns is that they don't work. Largely inclined to agree. That's why we decreased funding in the past.
"McGuigan says Future Executive Program budget line will be renamed to Rix's new replacement program. But at a council meeting earlier in the year, it was said council was to discuss which program it was moving forward with. Is that not happening now?"
COCA budget down from $3500 to $2800 because conference will be in Fredericton.
A question is raised about whether council still has quorum (which is apparently does) and I think I just dropped an f-bomb on the livestream!
"Onto the Wave. Projected $16k increase to food sales, $9K decrease to liquor sales. Food costs expected to increase $20k."
Staff training expected to increase from $1.5k to $4k. Wages also expected to increase from $88k to $96k.
"WE'RE STILL GOING ON THE DRAFT BUDGET. Yearbook ad revenue expected to decrease $700, yearbook sale revenue expected to be $1,500."
Chief returning officer salary would increase from $800 to $1200.
Did I just hear there would be CPR training at council orientation? lmaoooo
New $2k that would go to councillor development. (If it works it would save the SU thousands of dollars in legal expenses from council members going rogue!)
Audit fees (for financials) will increase to $12.5K. Legal fees projected at $5k. Should the recently approved investigations have been included in the budget?
"@scottgrant37 What's the correct way to advertise?

(Also assumes issue is with communication and not with content)"
Onto elections and referenda bylaw.
What's this distinction between a winter and spring general election? One of these doesn't exist.
"Policy committee is proposing that SU executives be elected first, and then councillor positions would be elected afterwards."
@scottgrant37 But back to my original question: what's the correct way to advertise?
Reading of the changes is done. Now looking at a presentation on the proposed Health &amp; Wellness Program and the SU's health plan reserves (which would fund a portion of the program in its first year if approved).
"Fact-check: I don't think the SU was one of the founding schools of the campus trust. I thought it was Acadia, MUN, and an Ontario school (Brock?)?"
@scottgrant37 How is this much different from what the SU does currently?
"SU talks about the health plan reserves without actually saying how much are in them (the executive said $16k in them last meeting, but the presentation said they need 3-6 months worth of funds (which I suspect is much more)."
"Presenters say the SU made a ""one-time"" investment of $20K. It was never communicated as such at the time it was approved (I was on council at the time) and my impression was that it would be refilled when it expired."
Presenters further said there was no promotion for the old program. There was literally a big ass poster beside the SU's office stairs.
"Says there was not much communication about why the program ended. (When The Cadre reached out to the university, we were told only 0.5% of students accessed the service)"
@ferguson_mi Was along the stairs. And anyone who ever goes up to the SU office (for health plan or for whatever).
"Well there it is: there is a whopping $675,000 in the health plan reserves. Crazy to think that the exec tried to pass it off as $16k when trying to promote the new wellness program. Any argument that the MHIF couldn't be preserved as is falls flat on its face."
"@ferguson_mi It's not ""no promotion,"" which is my point."
@haley927 @ferguson_mi There might have been. I don't know. I'm only saying there was a big poster by the stairs. It might be presumptuous of us to say there was no other advertising.
@haley927 @ferguson_mi The presentation is already pretty slanted toward a preferred outcome.
"Here's my question: if almost nobody used a similar program the last time we had it, why plan to make all students pay for it via referendum? Why not factor it into the SU's health plan coverage?"
@emileyfaithe Yep!
"Stormy Daniels says on the second occasion with Donald Trump, they didn't have sex but just watched Shark Week. The meet-up was to discuss whether she could appear on Celebrity Apprentice. She did not appear."
"@slwasylyshyn Currently under our governing doc, if you’re impeached there is a two-year period where you are unable to run again. An exception can be made if you present to council requesting an exemption and it is approved."
"@slwasylyshyn We're still The Cadre! My recommendation is that you don't get involved with student media afterwards, hahaha. Find a personal passion you already have but don't have enough time to dedicate to atm and do that when you've finished your term!"
@TayaNabuurs @ferguson_mi @UPEISU @UPEISUCouncil Nobody is saying it should be used for whatever we want; some councillors just want a dedicated fund for mental health initiatives. And renewing the MHIF would in no way place the SU in a financially precarious situation; you'd still fall well within the healthy $$ reserve range.
"@TayaNabuurs @ferguson_mi @UPEISU @UPEISUCouncil You could implement Aspiria at the cited cost and MHIF (which was $20k initial funding) without much change to the health plan. $2k+ expenditures last night showed average monthly exp. on health plan were approximately $110k, so you'd still have 4-5 months worth of reserves."

"2. The province is introducing the Island Advantage bursary at $3.6k/Island student. This will complement the George Coles bursary/Island Student Award, which contribute a combined $5.2k over a student’s first four-year degree."
1. IT’S BUDGET DAY!! Let me break down some of the #peibudget highlights are they pertain to postsecondary education. I will focus mainly on the university side of things. #peipoli
"5. Although I’m not sure about the prevalence, one issue I'd heard about anecdotally suggested that students would capitalize on the big first year disbursement by studying at UPEI and then transferring off-island to finish their degree at their preferred institution."
"4. Previously under the George Coles/ISA setup, financial support was inconsistent from year to year: 1st year was $2.2k, 2nd was $600, 3rd was $400, and 4th was $2000 (or spread out over 4th and 5th year). This was iffy for a few reasons."
"3. The new bursary means students will now receive $2.2k each year, which is approximately 1/3rd of the current tuition cost of a full course load (excluding ancillary fees)."
"9. (And although I have some residual bitterness - I’m happy government has changed their tune, even just a little, on needs-based aid since last year) https://t.co/R36onRJANL)"
"8. Why is this important? As I note here, PEI has made poor progress on getting people from lower-income backgrounds into PSE. This will help these students to enroll, remain in school, and graduate with less debt. https://t.co/jEiy5hqVJf"
7. The province will also introduce an additional bursary for students meeting the income requirements for the Canada Student Grant. The province expects over 1000 students will have FREE TUITION as a result.
"6. The new changes might help discourage that course of action. More importantly, the changes align with past @UPEISU polling that showed a significant majority of students were in favor of a consistent annual disbursement of financial aid."
"12. Why am I not sold on the effectiveness of the initiative? In the last few years, at least two provinces cut similar programs geared at retaining/attracting graduates to their province."
"11. To provide some context, MPHEC has previously reported that while PEI was the best maritime province at retaining graduates overall, it was the worst at retaining its own students. https://t.co/BAOqdW3zaR"
10. The government has also announced that it will offer a debt reduction grant of $3.5K/year to island graduates who reside on PEI within three years of graduating. This sounds good in principle but I’m not as convinced in practice.
15. I’m inclined to agree both on the need to invest upfront to prevent debt in the first place and the importance of jobs in encouraging people to live somewhere (although to be fair I think there's a different intent behind this initiative and it isn't one of those two).
"14. When NB scrapped its’ up-to-$20,000/person tuition rebate program, the finance minister said there were better ways to help needy students and that job creation was key to retention. https://t.co/29sHktMdUc"
"13. When Manitoba cut its tuition rebate program, the finance minister claimed that there was no evidence to support the notion that the program was achieving its goals. https://t.co/LOfHjjR8UW"
17. Government will increase the annual operating funding grant to UPEI by 2%. This is the biggest increase in recent memory. Here's what past funding looked like according to UPEI's 17-18 budget: https://t.co/vSTPfbNKZi
"16. Basically, I’m skeptical on how well the program will retain graduates and I’d be interested to hear how government intends to measure its effectiveness (if that’s even possible)."
20. The government will be investing in mental health resources with per student funding of $25. This is very welcome – universities have become a first point of access for many students when it comes to mental health supports. https://t.co/uecb3s05ZE
"19. Government is also committing to a multi-year funding agreement with the University. This will give students a better sense of what to expect tuition-wise down the road, and will make planning less stressful for the UPEI administration."
18. It will be interesting to see how tuition will change for next year. Normally it has increased by 3%-4% on a 1% operating grant increase – so UPEI could choose to have a smaller tuition increase or increase tuition by 3%-4% and expand its operations. Either is good!
21. Overall it's a great budget for students and PSE institutions on PEI. Congrats @CornwallHeath and @SonnyGallant and also to @UPEISU and its (old) staff (@TayaNabuurs @johnathanrix @TWAGordon) for their hard work on these issues over the years! Y'all should be proud!!! /end

"2. Something that might go under the radar and is much more interesting is the release of repatriation survey data collected by the provincial government (available here:
https://t.co/uEBaXQoqTV ). Here are some highlights and thoughts:"
"1. #peipoli THREAD: The province has launched a new campaign, ~Maybe You Should Come Home~, encouraging repatriation to the Island (deets here: https://t.co/Z6srTerwDd). You can even win a one-way ticket to PEI (someone thought this was clever...). BUT!"
"4. Now keep in mind that 72% of respondents received a post-secondary education on PEI, more than those who reported being born or raised here, which might affect that last number. https://t.co/NAC4tF3F7L"
"3. First, Charlottetown is by far the place potential repatriates associate with their time on PEI; great news if you want to bring them back to Charlottetown! Bad news if government is looking to bring people to rural communities. #peipoli https://t.co/pnKZOzaulM"
"6. Employment-related issues appear to be a HUGE barrier to repatriation: 70% of respondents left PEI for work, 83% say employment is impeding a return to PEI, and 70%+ of those not wanting to return blamed employment-related reasons. #peipoli https://t.co/V7isxASCXr"
5. But it does raise the question: is Charlottetown one of the biggest losers when it comes to out-migration? (I don’t know – more research needed. Or maybe someone knows?) Anywho...
"8. Respondents' current occupations are predominantly education, law/social/govt services, and health (read: largely government-reliant), yet this campaign only promotes entrepreneurs or quasi-entrepreneurs as the success stories of people repatriating. https://t.co/uX2CScn7TL"
"7. Respondents’ reported incomes also don’t inspire optimism: 70% or more reported household incomes greater than the median PEI household income, which is worrisome when salary considerations were reported as a significant factor in deciding to return. #peipoli https://t.co/kfoMiW9Wib"
"11. Only twice in the last ten years (of available data) have we seen positive net-interprovincial migration. And! retention and repatriation are clearly youth issues, per the data:
#peipoli https://t.co/WlMGNjGfmy"
"10. Anyhow, I feel like there’s a bit of a fatal misalignment here. It’s not a stretch to say people stay/leave and (want to) come back for the same reasons (financial security if we're to believe the survey), but we’ve not yet been able to get people to stay."
"9. Furthermore, although govt cites YDay 2017 as a reason for a repatriation campaign, work-related discussions I participated in went along the lines of ""don't use self-employment to get out of ensuring there are jobs available"". Not everyone wants the entrepreneur lifestyle."
P.S. Hope you learned something from this! If there are other topics you'd like to have covered let me know and I'll see if I can do it.
"12. In my opinion, unless we finally address the underlying causes behind the decisions to leave our province (again, largely financially and employment-related) and can retain people on an ongoing basis, it doesn't make much sense to think we can magically coax others back. /end"

"@zac_murph @jbgreenan Regardless of listing differences between Charlottetown and Toronto, the principle of the bylaw change is the same: it would reintroduce units for long-term rental. That is a ~good~ thing, and no, it doesn't have to be and shouldn't be the only thing we do."
"@ayouland 1) Can you clarify? Aren't registered with Tourism PEI? Airbnb units outside of Charlottetown? W be q's for either provincial government or Airbnb/equivalent. Most are registered.
