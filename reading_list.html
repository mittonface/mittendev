            <p>To make myself look smarter than I am, here's a page that lists some books that I'm reading / have read and a quick thought about them.</p>
            <h2>Currently Reading</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/233649.The_Great_Hunt">The Great Hunt (WoT #2)</a> <i>Robert Jordan</i></li>
                <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18774964-a-man-called-ove">A Man Called Ove</a> <i>Fredrik Backman</i></li>
                <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32899495-hands-on-machine-learning-with-scikit-learn-and-tensorflow">Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn & Tensorflow</a> <i>Aurélien Géron</i></li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Read</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1268479.Warbreaker">Warbreaker</a> <i>Brandon Sanderson</i></li>I might consider this the weakest of the Sanderson that I've read, though I usually evaluate the series as a whole. It was still pretty fun to read though!
                <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34017126-the-stone-sky">The Stone Sky</a><i> N.K. Jemisin</i></li>If you like "fantasy" books at all, read this entire trilogy. It's not surprising at all that each book in this series won a Hugo award.
                <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26228034-the-obelisk-gate">The Obelisk Gate</a><i> N.K. Jemisin</i></li>
                <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19161852-the-fifth-season">The Fifth Season</a><i> N.K. Jemisin</i></li>
                <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/228665.The_Eye_of_the_World">The Eye of the World (WoT #1)</a><i> Robert Jordan</i></li> I'm reading WoT to scratch the itch I have for extremely deep fantasy worlds. Honestly I hope the pace picks up a bit in later books, but I'm sufficiently hooked.
                <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34704992-edgedancer">Edgedancer</a><i> Brandon Sanderson</i></li>I'm pretty into Sanderson despite the fact that I don't think he's the best writer (I don't know what I mean by this, really). It was nice to be back in the Stormlight Archive world.
                <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16788.Fragile_Things">Fragile Things</a><i> Neil Gaiman</i></li>I can't give this a glowing review, despite the fact that I really loved some of the stories. That's probably just the way compilations work.
                <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/368593.The_4_Hour_Workweek">The 4-Hour Workweek</a><i> Timothy Ferris</i></li>I didn't really take away anything impactful from this book. The notion of getting a remote position and then moving somewhere that your dollar has more purchasing power is neat but not really in the cards for me.
                <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/113934.The_Goal">The Goal</a><i> Eliyahu Goldratt</i></li>Great narrative and some great ways to frame problems in here. This was actually a page-turner which I didn't really expect.
                <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6607720-clean-code">Clean Code</a><i> Robert C. Martin</i></li>I should have read this sooner in my programming career. Everything in here was knowledge that I <i>should</i> have had, but I feel like spelling it out instantly improved my code quality.
                <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25744928-deep-work">Deep Work</a><i> Cal Newport</i></li>Some things in here I'll find hard to apply to professional work, but will definitely apply to "extra-curricular" work. At the very least it's nice to have the "shallow work" and "deep work" labels to use.
                <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15839976-red-rising">Red Rising</a><i> Pierce Brown</i></li>Something about this book feels very "boys will be boys" sort of in the way something like <i>Ender's Game</i> does. Don't get me wrong, I almost couldn't put it down, but it doesn't make me feel good that I liked it.
